# Never Fail a FERPA Audit Again

## The Problem
FERPA requires schools to protect "education records" - but gives no
specific technical requirements. Vendors claim "FERPA compliance" even
though FERPA applies to schools, not vendors.

**The result?** Schools can't tell which vendors actually protect student data.

## The Consequences
- 3,713 data breaches in K-12 since 2005
- 37.6 million student records exposed
- 55% of breaches caused by vendors
- No enforcement until after the breach

## Our Solution
We're designed as a "school official" under FERPA's legitimate educational
interest exception - with the documentation to prove it.

**What This Means:**
✓ Pre-signed Data Processing Agreement with FERPA provisions
✓ Audit trail showing exactly what was anonymized
✓ No data retention - records can't be breached if they don't exist
✓ SDPC National DPA alignment

## How It Works
1. Connect your data source (LMS, SIS, or upload files)
2. Select what needs anonymization
3. Choose your method (replace, redact, encrypt)
4. Download anonymized files with audit log
5. Store original in your secure system, share anonymized version

## Proof
- SOC 2 Type II certified infrastructure
- Zero data breaches since launch
- Pre-completed FERPA security questionnaire
- [Download our DPA] [Download FERPA checklist]

## Start Now
[Try Free - 500 documents/month] [Schedule Demo]

## Visual Design Direction

### Theme: "Protective Clarity"

**Aesthetic:** Clean, trustworthy, institutional but not boring. Think: modern university library meets security operations center.

### Colors
- **Primary:** Deep teal (#0d7377) - trust, education, calm
- **Secondary:** Warm slate (#3d5a6c) - professionalism
- **Accent:** Confident amber (#f59e0b) - action, alerts
- **Background:** Warm off-white (#fafaf9) - approachable
- **Success:** Green (#059669) - safety, completion

### Typography
- **Headlines:** Instrument Sans or Cabinet Grotesk - modern, confident
- **Body:** Source Sans 3 or IBM Plex Sans - readable, professional
- **Mono:** JetBrains Mono - technical credibility

### Visual Elements
- **Icons:** Line icons with occasional solid accent
- **Illustrations:** Minimal, geometric, purposeful
- **Photography:** If used, real schools, diverse students (silhouettes/backs for privacy)
- **Data viz:** Clean charts showing protection stats
- **Trust badges:** Prominent but not cluttered

### Micro-interactions
- Subtle hover states on cards
- Smooth scroll transitions
- Loading states that show progress
- Success animations on form completion

---

## Content Reuse from Current Site

### Keep (adapt to new structure):
- Use case scenarios (update with solution framing)
- Impressum/Imprint content
- Datenschutz/Privacy policy (update with education specifics)
- Contact form
- Brand assets (logo, colors)

### Rewrite Completely:
- Homepage (problem-first approach)
- Features → Solutions
- Products → Works With
- Pricing (education tiers)
- All marketing copy

### Create New:
- Solution pages (FERPA, COPPA, etc.)
- Audience pages (K-12, Higher Ed, etc.)
- Integration pages
- Trust center
- Resource center
- Templates & downloads

---

## Success Metrics

### Primary
- **Conversion:** Visitor → Free trial signup
- **Activation:** Signup → First document anonymized
- **Retention:** Monthly active schools

### Secondary
- **SEO:** Rankings for "FERPA compliance tool", "student data anonymization"
- **Content:** DPA downloads, guide views
- **Trust:** Security page visits before signup

---

- Home page (solution machine approach)
- /solutions/ferpa
- /solutions/coppa
- /pricing (education tiers)
- /trust/security (zero-knowledge)
