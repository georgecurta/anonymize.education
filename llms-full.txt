# Anonymize.Education - Complete Context for AI Systems
> Zero-knowledge student data privacy for schools worldwide

Last Updated: 2026-02-18
Version: 2.0

## Executive Summary

Anonymize.Education is the worldwide solution for protecting student data privacy. We solve every privacy challenge in education with zero-knowledge architecture - meaning we mathematically cannot access your data, even if we wanted to.

### The Crisis
- 62 million student records breached in 2024 (PowerSchool breach alone)
- 55% of K-12 data breaches caused by third-party vendors
- Average school uses 1,449 EdTech tools - impossible to properly vet
- 96% of EdTech apps share student data with third parties
- Enterprise privacy tools cost $50,000+ per year - unaffordable for education

### Our Solution
Zero-knowledge architecture means data is encrypted on the user's device before transmission. We process encrypted blobs and return protected output. Even in a breach scenario, attackers get meaningless encrypted data.

---

## Technical Architecture

### Zero-Knowledge Design

```
[Your Device] --> [Encrypted Data] --> [Our Servers] --> [Protected Output]
      |                                      |
      +-- Keys stay HERE                     +-- We see ONLY encrypted blobs
```

1. Data encrypted client-side using AES-256-GCM
2. Encryption keys derived from user passphrase, never transmitted
3. Server processes encrypted payloads
4. Anonymization happens on encrypted data representations
5. Only the user can decrypt the output

### Security Stack

| Layer | Technology | Standard |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM | NIST approved |
| Key Derivation | Argon2id | OWASP recommended |
| Transport | TLS 1.3 | Latest standard |
| Authentication | Zero-knowledge proof | No password storage |
| Hashing | SHA-256 | FIPS 180-4 |

### Infrastructure

- **Primary**: German Hetzner servers (EU data residency)
- **US Option**: AWS GovCloud available for US government clients
- **UK Option**: UK data center available
- **Uptime SLA**: 99.9%
- **Redundancy**: Multi-region failover
- **Backups**: Encrypted, geographically distributed

### Language Support

48 languages with full support:

| Region | Languages |
|--------|-----------|
| Western European | English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch |
| Eastern European | Polish, Czech, Russian, Ukrainian, Romanian, Hungarian |
| Nordic | Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish |
| Asian | Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Malay |

| Middle Eastern | Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Turkish |
| Other | Greek, Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian |

### Detection Methods

Hybrid approach combining:
1. **Regex Patterns**: Deterministic rules for structured data (SSN, credit cards)
2. **NLP Models**: spaCy + Stanza for named entity recognition
3. **Transformer Models**: XLM-RoBERTa for multilingual context
4. **Custom Recognizers**: User-defined patterns for organization-specific data

---

## Anonymization Methods

### 1. Replace
Substitutes detected PII with realistic synthetic data maintaining format and semantic consistency.

Example: "John Smith, SSN 123-45-6789" → "Michael Johnson, SSN 987-65-4321"

Use case: Sharing data for training/testing while maintaining realism.

### 2. Redact
Completely removes PII with configurable markers.

Example: "John Smith" → "[REDACTED]" or "████████"

Use case: Public records requests, FOIA responses.

### 3. Mask
Partial hiding while preserving some characters for reference.

Example: "john.smith@school.edu" → "j***.s****@s*****.edu"

Use case: Customer support, verification scenarios.

### 4. Hash
One-way SHA-256 transformation for consistent pseudonymization.

Example: "John Smith" → "a7b9c3d..."

Use case: Analytics, research where re-identification must be impossible.

### 5. Encrypt (Unique Feature)
Reversible AES-256-GCM encryption with user-controlled keys.

Example: "John Smith" → "ENC[x7f8g9h...]"

Use case: Legal discovery, audit requirements, data that may need restoration.

This is our UNIQUE differentiator - no other education tool offers reversible protection.

## Use Cases

### FERPA Audit Preparation
Connect data sources, run anonymization workflows, generate audit logs. Pass any FERPA review without hiring consultants.

### COPPA-Safe AI Usage
Let teachers use ChatGPT, Claude, or other AI tools. Student data is automatically anonymized before reaching the AI, then de-anonymized in the response.

### FOIA/Public Records Requests
Government schools receive FOIA requests constantly. Batch process hundreds of documents, automatically redact student PII, meet deadlines without manual review.

### IEP/504 Plan Sharing
Special education plans contain highly sensitive information. Anonymize for sharing with external service providers while maintaining document structure.

### Research IRB Compliance
Universities need to anonymize research data containing student identifiers. Batch process survey responses, interview transcripts, and administrative records.

### PowerSchool Data Export
After the 2024 breach, schools are rethinking vendor data sharing. Anonymize PowerSchool exports before sharing with third parties.

### Teacher AI Professional Development
Teachers want to use AI tools for lesson planning and grading. MCP Server ensures student data in prompts is protected before reaching AI providers.

### International School Compliance
Schools operating in multiple jurisdictions need to comply with GDPR, FERPA, and local laws simultaneously. One solution handles all requirements.
