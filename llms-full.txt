### How We Protect

Five different ways to anonymize data. Choose the right method for each situation.

#### 1. Replace

Swaps real data with fake but realistic data. Best for sharing documents externally while keeping them readable. Example: "John Smith" becomes "Michael Johnson"

#### 2. Redact

Removes data completely, shows [REDACTED] placeholder. Best for official reports where data must be completely hidden. Example: "John Smith" becomes "[PERSON]"

#### 3. Hash (SHA-256)

Creates a unique code from the data. Same input always gives same output. Best for research where you need to track patterns without knowing real names. Example: "John Smith" becomes "a7b3c9d2..."

#### 4. Encrypt (AES-256)

Scrambles data so only you can unscramble it later. Best for when you need to restore original data later. Example: "John Smith" becomes encrypted text you can decrypt

#### 5. Mask

Partially hides data while keeping some context. Best for quick previews where some context is helpful. Example: "John Smith" becomes "Jo** Sm***"

### 48 Languages Supported

Automatic language detection. Works with mixed-language documents. Right-to-left support included.

English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Russian, Ukrainian, Arabic (RTL), Hebrew (RTL), Persian (RTL), Urdu (RTL), Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Thai, Vietnamese, Turkish, Greek, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, and 19 more.

## Use Cases

URL: https://anonymize.education/use-cases.html

> Real scenarios for schools, universities, and researchers. See how educational institutions protect student data.

### Real Education Scenarios

See how schools and universities use Anonymize.Education to protect student and staff data every day.

### Use Case 1: Sharing Student Records with External Parties

**The Problem:** Schools often need to share student files with external evaluators, auditors, contractors, or partner institutions. But GDPR and other regulations prohibit sharing identifiable student information without proper consent.

**The Solution:** Use the Replace method to swap real names with realistic fake names. The document remains readable and professional, but no actual student can be identified.

Example:
- Before: "Maria Schmidt achieved excellent results in mathematics."
- After: "Sophie Weber achieved excellent results in mathematics."

Best tool: Desktop App or Office Add-in

### Use Case 2: AI-Assisted Grading and Feedback

**The Problem:** Teachers want to use AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude for grading assistance, generating feedback, or analyzing student work. But sending student names and personal information to AI companies violates data protection policies.

**The Solution:** Use the MCP Server to automatically strip all personal identifiers before text reaches the AI. Get AI assistance without exposing any student data.

How it works: Teacher types -> MCP Server removes names -> AI provides feedback -> Names restored in response

Best tool: MCP Server (Pro or Business tier)

### Use Case 3: Publishing Educational Research

**The Problem:** Educational researchers need to publish findings based on student data, but cannot include real identities. They also need to track patterns across multiple data points without knowing who is who.

**The Solution:** Use the Hash (SHA-256) method. Each name becomes a unique code that's consistent across documents. "Student A" always maps to the same hash, enabling longitudinal studies without identification.

Example:
- Before: "Jan Kowalski" (appears 15 times in dataset)
- After: "a7b3c9d2e5f8..." (same hash each time)

Best tool: Web Platform with batch processing

### Use Case 4: Creating Parent Communication Templates

**The Problem:** School administrators want to create template libraries from successful parent communications. But real letters contain student names and sensitive details that cannot be shared.

**The Solution:** Use the Redact method to completely remove all personal information. Placeholders like [STUDENT_NAME] make templates easy to use while protecting privacy.

Example:
- Before: "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Fischer, your son Max..."
- After: "Dear [PARENT_NAMES], your [CHILD_RELATION] [STUDENT_NAME]..."

Best tool: Desktop App or Office Add-in

### Use Case 5: Training New Staff with Real Examples

**The Problem:** New teachers and staff need realistic training materials based on actual student files. But using real student data for training purposes is not permitted under data protection laws.

**The Solution:** Use the Replace method to create realistic training materials. Real documents become training examples with fictional but believable student profiles.

Benefits:
- Realistic scenarios for effective training
- No risk of privacy violations
- Reusable training library

Best tool: Desktop App with batch processing

### Use Case 6: Demonstrating Compliance in Audits

**The Problem:** Schools must demonstrate GDPR compliance to auditors and regulators. This often requires showing examples of data processing without exposing actual personal data.

**The Solution:** Use any anonymization method to create audit-ready documentation. The audit trail shows your data protection processes while keeping actual data private.

What you can show auditors:
- Anonymized sample documents
- Process documentation
- ISO 27001 certification

Best tool: Any tool + history/logging features

### More Education Scenarios

#### 7. Student Exchange Programs

Sharing student profiles with partner schools abroad. Replace personal details while keeping academic achievements visible.

#### 8. Special Needs Documentation

Discussing accommodation strategies without identifying students. Redact identifiers for professional development discussions.

#### 9. Grant Applications

Including case studies in funding proposals. Replace with fake names to illustrate impact without privacy risks.

#### 10. Alumni Communications

Creating newsletter content featuring student achievements. Mask partial names or get explicit consent with anonymized backups.

#### 11. Online Learning Platforms

EdTech vendors requesting access to usage data. Hash student IDs before sharing analytics with vendors.

#### 12. Conference Presentations

Educators presenting case studies at conferences. Replace all identifiers for public presentations.

### Understanding Tokens

Tokens are like credits. Each operation uses tokens based on text length and detected entities.

#### Typical Token Usage

| Text Length | Tokens Used | Example |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Short text | 1-3 tokens | A paragraph, email signature |
| Medium text | 3-5 tokens | A letter, short report |
| Long text | 5-15 tokens | Multi-page document |

200 free tokens = approximately 15-18 pages of text per month.

Note: Anonymization uses slightly more tokens than analysis alone. AI entity creation requires 50 tokens per request.

### Need More Tokens?

Top up anytime. Higher tiers get better rates.

| Tier | Top-Up Rate |
|------|------------|
| Free | Top-ups not available |
| Basic | 1 for 250 tokens |
| Pro | 1 for 300 tokens |
| Business | 1 for 350 tokens |

Monthly tokens reset each billing cycle and do not accumulate. Top-up tokens expire at cycle reset.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What are tokens exactly?**
Tokens are like credits or coins. Each time you analyze or anonymize text, you use tokens based on the length of the text and the number of entities detected. Think of them like prepaid phone minutes.

**Do unused tokens roll over to the next month?**
No, monthly tokens reset at the beginning of each billing cycle. However, if you top up with additional tokens, those also expire at your next cycle reset. This keeps pricing simple and predictable.

**Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime?**
Yes, you can change your plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

**Is the Desktop App really free?**
Yes, the Desktop App is completely free for basic use. It works offline and doesn't require an account. Some advanced features (like custom presets) require a paid account.

**Are there education discounts available?**
We offer volume discounts for school districts and academic institutions. Please contact us to discuss your specific needs.

**What payment methods do you accept?**
We accept major credit cards and PayPal. For enterprise accounts, we can arrange invoicing with purchase orders.
