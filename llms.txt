# Anonymize.Education
> Zero-knowledge student data privacy. Used by 1,200+ schools worldwide.

## What We Do

Anonymize.Education protects student data with zero-knowledge architecture. We never see your data. Neither do hackers.

Schools face a privacy crisis: 62 million student records were breached in 2024 (PowerSchool alone). 55% of K-12 data breaches come from vendors. We solve this by encrypting data on your device before it ever reaches our servers.

## The Problem We Solve

- **Vendor breaches**: 55% of K-12 breaches are from third-party vendors
- **Too many tools**: Average school uses 1,449 EdTech tools - impossible to vet them all
- **Data sharing**: 96% of EdTech apps share student data with third parties
- **Expensive alternatives**: Enterprise privacy tools cost $50,000+ per year

## Our Solution: Zero-Knowledge Architecture

Your student data is encrypted before it leaves your device. We process encrypted blobs - we mathematically cannot see your data. Even if we were hacked, attackers get nothing.

### Technical Architecture
- Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
- Keys never leave your device
- In-memory processing only
- No plaintext data storage
- SOC 2 Type II audited

## Capabilities

### Data Detection

### Anonymization Methods
1. **Replace**: Substitute with realistic fake data
2. **Redact**: Remove completely with [REDACTED] marker
