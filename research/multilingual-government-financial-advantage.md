| **Legal evidence** | ❌ Problematic (model drift) | ✓ Court-admissible |

## Conclusion

The 48 languages + regional dialects capability is a **critical differentiator** that was underemphasized in the current concept. For government and financial institutions:

1. **Multilingual processing is not optional** - it's legally required
2. **Regional variants matter** - Catalan is not Spanish, Flemish is not Dutch
3. **Audit-proof detection is essential** - regulators require reproducible results
4. **No competitor offers this combination** - 48 languages + dialects + deterministic + EU sovereignty

This should be positioned as a **primary investment thesis pillar**, not a secondary feature.
